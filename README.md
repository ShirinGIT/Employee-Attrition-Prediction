# Employee-Attrition-Prediction


üìä About the Project
This project involved analyzing a comprehensive dataset to identify factors influencing employee retention and developing a machine learning model to predict attrition. The results are insightful and can help organizations improve satisfaction and retention strategies.

üîç Key Highlights
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships between features like income, overtime, and work-life balance.

- Built a Gradient Boosting Classifier achieving 87.4% testing accuracy, enabling reliable predictions.
- Balanced the dataset using oversampling to handle class imbalance effectively.

üí° Insights
- Employees with frequent overtime or low-income levels are more likely to leave.
- Poor work-life balance and extensive business travel significantly increase attrition rates.

üìà Impact

This project showcases the practical application of machine learning in HR analytics, offering actionable insights to proactively address employee dissatisfaction and retention challenges.

üíª Tools & Techniques

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier for predictive modeling
- Data preprocessing and visualization

Recommendations

Based on the conclusions drawn from the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:
1. Enhance Job Satisfaction: Implement programs to improve job satisfaction, especially for employees with satisfaction levels below. This could include regular feedback, recognition, and career development opportunities.
2. Promote Career Growth: Ensure timely promotions and clear career progression paths to retain employees, particularly those who have not been promoted in the last 0-5 years.
3. Work-Life Balance: Foster a healthy work-life balance by providing flexible work arrangements and managing workloads to prevent excessive overtime.
4. Training Programs: Focus on the quality and relevance of training programs rather than the number of sessions. Tailor training to meet employees' career goals and job requirements.
5. Competitive Compensation: Review and adjust compensation packages to ensure they are competitive and reflect employees' performance and contributions.
6. Improve Workplace Culture: Enhance the work environment and culture to foster a supportive and engaging atmosphere, which can help reduce attrition.
